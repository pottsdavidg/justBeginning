# justBeginning
This repository is for all of my projects I made to learn from. Comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  Created repository and began working on my first addition to it. 
  Most of these projects will be from freeCodeCamp.org and reflect the projects required to get their certificates in frontend/backend development. 
  This will not include projects in Python, as I will set up a separate repository for those projects.
  This is the beginning of a long road ahead.
  I am dedicated to this journey and expect to get great things from it.
