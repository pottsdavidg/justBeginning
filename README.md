# justBeginning
This repository is for all of my projects I made to learn from. Comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  Created repository and began working on my first addition to it. 
  Most of these projects will be from freeCodeCamp.org and reflect the projects required to get their certificates in frontend/backend development. 
  This will not include projects in Python, as I will set up a separate repository for those projects.
  This is the beginning of a long road ahead.
  I am dedicated to this journey and expect to get great things from it.

  Got a little caught up with work and school, however I finished my tictactoe game webpage and tribute page. Both uploaded today.
  Working on making the other today as well and will upload if I finish the landing page or survey form. Both should be pretty easy.
  The tic tac toe game that I made doesn't have a single player option, but planning on adding my AI that I made in python to the files.
  It will be able to take the gameState from the JavaScript file and return the move it will make.
  Also need to add some more funcitonality to the tic tac toe game like a menu with buttons.
